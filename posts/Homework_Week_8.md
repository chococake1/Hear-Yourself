<h3>Response</h3>
My piece responds to Kerry Mitchell's Gallery 47, using simple geometry to make something interesting, but looking at the rubric, I decided I had to make something with
much more depth, so I added movement and user interactivity

<h3>Reflection</h3>
For my assignment 2, we were to make a 'Chaotic' Javascript piece, for my assignment I chose to make a square that bounces around the screen, leaving behind previously
made squares, clicking the screen will make the square freeze, originally I wanted it to create a small square that sorted the pixels on screen by colour but could not get
it working so I settled on this. Next time I could organise my time better so I could finish on time, though I was sick for 2 weeks of class, so there was a fair bit of 
material I had to catch up on. If I had attended those classes, I would have liked to include fractals or the aforementioned pixel sorting squares that I couldn't
figure out in time.

I decided to call the compositino 'squares dreaming' since I thought it fit the trippy look of the piece, especially after the screen is fileld up
